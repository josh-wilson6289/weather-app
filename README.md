This web app utilized the open weather map api to display weather data to the user.

The user sees the current weather, plus a five day forecast.

After entering a city, the user can then click on previous cities below the search field to switch to another city.

Ideally, this app will store city information into local storage and pre-load the user's search history, but I've had trouble implimenting that functionality.
